- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mediaqueries

### Useful resources

- [Microsoft Power Toys](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/powertoys/) - I use Microsoft Power Toys a lot. It includes a tool called Screen Ruler, which is incredibly useful for measuring designs if you don't have the design Adobe XD or Figma file. Additionally it offers a wide range of other handy features, such as Color Picker, Text Grab and a lot more. My favorite tool since you can use it on any program, unlike chrome or other browsers where you have to install a bunch of extensions.
